# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** dusted off RStudio, read in my corpus of Beyoncé lyrics, selected what I needed, and began the cleaning process. Expanded contractions.

**Thoughts:** I've been kind of scared of going back to R after all this time using Python, but that Python experience has really helped me! I've also got a couple greatguides I'm working alongside. Looking forward to seeing what I can find in the data — but tomorrow I'll need to add a few things like album and year to the df. Formatting is a bit off on GitHub, so I'll be looking into that as well!

### Day 2: May 11th, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Learned how to knit Rmd files so they are displayed properly here! Also dove into basics of tidy text mining and explored different options for cleaning my dataset. How can I transform the data so I extract something meaningful?

**Thoughts:** I thought today would be much harder than it really was! Had a late start, but once I got going, I had plenty of things to work on. Just keep swimming!
