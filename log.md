# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** dusted off RStudio, read in my data and began the cleaning process. 

**Thoughts:** I've been kind of scared of going back to R after all this time using Python, but that Python experience has really helped me! I've also got a couple greatguides I'm working alongside. Looking forward to seeing what I can find in the data â€” but tomorrow I'll need to add a few things like album and year to the df. Formatting is a bit off on GitHub, so I'll be looking into that as well!
